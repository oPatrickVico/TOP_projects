## Things I learned

- Every time I wish to update state in a React component, I must create a new state, instead of mutating an old one. (Guess that's the functional programming I heard about.)
- Just like with my previous projects, I found repeated code that could be refactored. I thought it wasn't going to happen once I started using react, but nom I realise it must just a software development thing in general.
- There is a lot of value in short-term roadmaps! If, before start a coding session, I think about the things I aim to achieve and lay them all down — trully doing a top-down short term analysis — focusing on doing each task becomes easier. I recognise some similarities with scrum and now am tempted to read more about that.
